# Work Day Scheduler

# Task:
Create a calendar application that allows user to save events for each hour of the day. App runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. App uses [Moment.js library](https://momentjs.com/) to work with date and time.

# Acceptance Criteria
Allow users to add important events to daily planner so that time can be managed effectively by creating a schedule. When planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calander. Users are presented with color coded timeblocks for standard business hours within the current day that also indicate whether the corresponding block is past, present, or future. Timeblocks are also input forms that can be clicked into for documentation of corresponding events throughout the given day. Entries can then be saved to local storage by the user clicking on a "save" button next to each timeblock.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
